Multivariate Community Analysis

```{r, Hierarchical Clustering}


# calculate Bray-Curtis distance among samples
comm.bc.dist <- vegdist(comm, method = "bray")
# cluster communities using average-linkage algorithm
comm.bc.clust <- hclust(comm.bc.dist, method = "average")
# plot cluster diagram
plot(comm.bc.clust, ylab = "Bray-Curtis dissimilarity")


```
metaMDS is reducing the dimensionality of the data, making it easier to look at patterns in the data. In this case the bray-curtis distance matrix is used to examine dissimilarity of sites within the data. The stressplot is indicating how well the transformation represents the data. Here the R^2 value are good so I think the original data is well represented. Ordiplot is visualizing the MDS results. The samples that are clustered closer together are more similar. The ordination plot is then overlayed with color indicating the different relative moisture levels. This allows for visualization of possible relationships between relative moisture and the sample composition across sites


```{r, Ordination}


# The metaMDS function automatically transforms data and checks solution
# robustness
comm.bc.mds <- metaMDS(comm, dist = "bray")

# Assess goodness of ordination fit (stress plot)
stressplot(comm.bc.mds)

# plot site scores as text
ordiplot(comm.bc.mds, display = "sites", type = "text")

# automated plotting of results - tries to eliminate overlapping labels
ordipointlabel(comm.bc.mds)




# ordination plots are highly customizable set up the plotting area but
# don't plot anything yet
mds.fig <- ordiplot(comm.bc.mds, type = "none")
# plot just the samples, colour by relative moisture condition, pch=19 means plot a circle
points(mds.fig, "sites", pch = 19, col = "green", select = metadata$rel.moisture == 
    '1')
points(mds.fig, "sites", pch = 19, col = "blue", select = metadata$rel.moisture == 
    "2")
points(mds.fig, "sites", pch = 19, col = "red", select = metadata$rel.moisture == 
    "3")
# add confidence ellipses around relative moisture types
ordiellipse(comm.bc.mds, metadata$rel.moisture, conf = 0.95, label = TRUE)
# overlay the cluster results we calculated earlier
ordicluster(comm.bc.mds, comm.bc.clust, col = "gray")


# plot Sphaeralcea abundance. cex increases the size of bubbles.
ordisurf(comm.bc.mds, comm[, "Sphaeralcea_coccinea"], bubble = TRUE, main = "Sphaeralcea coccinea abundance", 
    cex = 3)


###Adding environmental and trait data to ordinations###

# calculate and plot environmental variable correlations with the axes use
# the subset of metadata that are environmental data

Trait Evolution

```{r, Phylogenetic signal}

# one way to do it - apply the Kcalc function to each column of the
# data.frame

# another way to do it with significance testing we have to convert the tree
# to be dichotomous before calculating P-values
multiPhylosignal(traits, multi2di(phy))

```

```{r, Visualizing trait evolution}

# Plot phylogeny facing upwards. Show node labels but not tip labels. cex
# shrinks labels.

    cex = 0.7)
# Plot leaf area on the phylogeny. cex argument scales symbol size by trait
# value.

    "LeafArea"])))

MNTD measures the mean nearest taxon distance, which is the distance between species in the community. The correlation results of r=0.86 and r=0.95 are close to 1 which I think indicates that the species within sites are closely related phylogentetically and in terms of functional traits.

```{r, phylogenetic beta-diversity}

# calculate phylogenetic MNTD beta diversity
comm.mntd.dist <- comdistnt(comm, phy.dist, abundance.weighted = TRUE)
# calculate functional trait MNTD beta diversity
comm.mntd.traits.dist <- comdistnt(comm, trait.dist, abundance.weighted = TRUE)
# calculate Mantel correlation for taxonomic Bray-Curtis vs. phylogenetic
# MNTD diversity
mantel(comm.bc.dist, comm.mntd.dist)

# calculate Mantel correlation for taxonomic Bray-Curtis vs. trait MNTD
# diversity
mantel(comm.bc.dist, comm.mntd.traits.dist)


```
NMDS ordination- Plotting distances (dissimilarity) in species composition between sites and colored to indicate relative moisture level. This is done to make patterns in the data easy to see. In this case, it should indicate if there is a relationship between relative moisture and the sample composition across sites. The ellipses indicate confidence interval. I not very confident in interpreting my data, the concept is a little complex to me still. It looks like there is some relationship here though. When looking at the green dots, which should indicate samples taken from 'sites', most are close together, indicating that those samples have similar species composition and similar relative moisture condition. The red dots show a somewhat similar trend. Overall
though the dots of each color are kind of spread loosely. The confidence intervals for are large and overlapping which makes me think it is hard to draw many conclusions from the graph.

```{r, phylogeny/trait-based ordinations}

# NMDS ordination of phylogenetic distances - use monoMDS since we only have
# among-sample distances
comm.mntd.mds <- monoMDS(comm.mntd.dist)
# set up the plotting area but don't plot anything yet
mds.fig <- ordiplot(comm.mntd.mds, type = "none")
# plot just the samples, colour by relative moisture, pch=19 means plot a circle
points(mds.fig, "sites", pch = 19, col = "green", select = metadata$rel.moisture == 
    "1")
points(mds.fig, "sites", pch = 19, col = "blue", select = metadata$rel.moisture == 
    "2")
points(mds.fig, "sites", pch = 19, col = "red", select = metadata$rel.moisture == 
    "3")
# add confidence ellipses around relative moisture types
ordiellipse(comm.mntd.mds, metadata$rel.moisture, conf = 0.95, label = TRUE)

# NMDS ordination of trait distances - use monoMDS since we only have
# among-sample distances
comm.mntd.traits.mds <- monoMDS(comm.mntd.traits.dist)
# set up the plotting area but don't plot anything yet
mds.fig <- ordiplot(comm.mntd.traits.mds, type = "none")
# plot just the samples, colour by relative moisture, pch=19 means plot a circle
points(mds.fig, "sites", pch = 19, col = "green", select = metadata$rel.moisture == 
    "1")
points(mds.fig, "sites", pch = 19, col = "blue", select = metadata$rel.moisture == 
    "2")
points(mds.fig, "sites", pch = 19, col = "red", select = metadata$rel.moisture == 
    "3")
# add confidence ellipses around relative moisture types
ordiellipse(comm.mntd.traits.mds, metadata$rel.moisture, conf = 0.95, label = TRUE)

```
Here we are looking if relative moisture level can explain the dissimilarity between samples/sites. We are looking at if it explains the 3 different ways of measuring dissimilarity (Bray-curtis, phylogenetic dissimilarity and trait dissimilarity.) The p values for all three tests were below 0.05 so the dissimilarity is influenced by the relative moisture level.

```{r, testing for multivariate differences among groups}

# Taxonomic (Bray-Curtis) dissimilarity explained
adonis2(comm.bc.dist ~ rel.moisture, data = metadata)

# Phylogenetic dissimilarity explained
adonis2(comm.mntd.dist ~ rel.moisture, data = metadata)

# Trait dissimilarity explained
adonis2(comm.mntd.traits.dist ~ rel.moisture, data = metadata)
